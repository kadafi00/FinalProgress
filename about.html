     Hello, my name is Travis Moore and I'm a student at The University of Advancing Technology. I'm an advancing computer sciences major 
     with a great passion for everything computers and programming. This is my first fully functional website and I sincerely hope that
     I will continue to thrive here, making great projects that I can be proud of when I graduate. With that being said, welcome to my first website. 
     I look forward to adding more content as I progress in skill so that this will eventually become my ideal portfolio.
